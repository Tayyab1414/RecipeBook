# Recipe Book Application

## Overview

This is a simple Java application for managing recipes. It consists of two main classes: `Recipe` and `RecipeBook`.

- **Recipe Class:** Represents a recipe with a name and a list of ingredients. It includes methods for getting the name and ingredients, as well as overriding `equals` and `hashCode` for proper object comparison.

- **RecipeBook Class:** Manages a collection of recipes. It includes methods for adding and removing recipes, searching for recipes based on a keyword, and retrieving the list of all recipes.

## Getting Started

To use the Recipe Book application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tayyab1414/RecipeBook.git
   ```

2. **Open in IDE:**
   Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3. **Run the Main Class:**
   Run the `Main` class to see a basic demonstration of the Recipe Book in action. This will add a recipe, search for recipes, and remove a recipe.

4. **Test the Application:**
   Run the provided JUnit test (`RecipeBookTest`) to ensure that the basic functionality is working correctly.
